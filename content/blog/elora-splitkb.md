## SplitKb.com - Elora

The Elora is a split keyboard with a unique layout and design. It is a 60% keyboard with a split design. The keyboard is designed to be ergonomic and comfortable to use. The Elora is a great keyboard for people who spend a lot of time typing and want a more comfortable typing experience to avoid wrist pain and other issues.

Before the Elora I was using 2 other SplitKb keyboards, the Sweep and Kyria, both also great split keyboards. The Sweep is a 34 keys split keyboard with a 2 + 2 thumb cluster and the Kyria is a 50 keys split keyboard with a 7 + 7 keys thumb cluster. The Elora is a Kyria with an additional top number row.

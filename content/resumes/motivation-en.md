# Motivation

Looking for challenges especially in tools and technology. Optimizing memory and performance, writing debug tools, data processing, workflow tools, (game engine) systems, automated testing, data analysis.

Have a lot of experience with C and C++ as well as C# and Golang. In the past I have also written a lot of MC68000 assembly language as well as PIC and Zilog micro controller assembly. The recent years it has been SSE/AVX and NEON for ARM.

Distributed data processing/conversion is also an area where I have experience and interest in. In the game industry it is standard practise to convert authoring data coming from tools like 3DS-Max and Maya into binary data that can be read directly by the game runtime. This kind of data is very often large and numerous and such a process can thus take many hours, the goal here is to make such a process as efficient and fast as possible.

I have also been exposed to and gathered experience with cryptography (encryption/decryption) as well as many compression algorithms. In the game industry it is common to compress data to optimize for space and bandwidth.

In the past i have worked for companies on micro-controllers, PIC and Zilog, and PLC's. At home my hobby is home automation and i have done a lot of projects on Arduino, ESP8266 and MX AZ3166. This includes working in embedded C and limited memory and performance.

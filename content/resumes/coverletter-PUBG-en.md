As an enthousiast of technology and software development I was thrilled to hear that apart from the succesfull game PUBG you are also working on a new game and technology. I am confident I can help with working and improving the technology in many areas, from tools to runtime. I have worked on many engines, from UE3 to UE4 as well as many proprietary engines.

In my current position at Virtuos Games I have worked on many platforms and have contributed a lot of strong pieces of technology to tools, runtime and CI/CD setups. My main focus has always been on simplicity and efficiency with tools to track and analyze tool and runtime characteristics. This has given us a realtime view, day in day out, into the behaviour of the runtime and data pipeline and has let us pro-actively act on things out of the normal. This has paid off in terms of having quick data builds and a stable game runtime.

I know that PUBG's current plan involved developing a new game, likely also targetted at the new generation of consoles. This is a great match for my personal and professional interests and an exciting opportunity to work on new technology and new platforms. I would love to leverage my knowledge of C/C++, C#, tools, distributed data pipeline and game engines to work on new game technology at PUBG.

I would welcome the chance to discuss how we could assist each other in reaching the goals and objectives that we have set.

Kind regards,
Jurgen Kluft

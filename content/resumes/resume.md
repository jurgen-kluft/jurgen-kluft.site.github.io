I am a Senior Software Engineer currently working at a large game out-sourcing company in Shanghai (China). In the past I have worked at various other big companies in the Netherlands including Guerrilla Games (Amsterdam) and ICT (Rotterdam). I am passionate about Software Engineering and Technology. Apart from [Game-Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_development) and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)/[C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language))/[Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)) I have special interest in [high performance C and C++](http://www.agner.org/optimize/optimizing_cpp.pdf) as well as [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system).
